      <p>Charges come in two types, positive and negative. 
        These charges interact with each other: one charge pushes or pulls on another depending on the types of each charge involved.
        In physics, we say this is because a charge creates an electric that communicates its influence.

        A positive charge creates a field that points away from itself.

        When thinking about the direction of the field, imagine two points.
        One point is the location of the charge itself. The other point is where the field is to be calculated.
        The field vector is along this line, either directly away from or directly toward the charge.

        As you get farther from a charge, the field decreases in strength. When drawing vectors, the length of an arrow indicates the magnitude.

            Though it would be difficult to show, every point in space has its own electric field. This is the defining feature of any field in physics, every point gets assigned a value.
        </p>
        <p>
            The electric field magnitude and distance from the charge have an <b>inverse square</b> relationship:
            \[ \Big| \vec{E} \, \Big| = \frac{| q | }{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \, r^2} \]
            In this formula, the amount of charge is represented by \(q\) and the symbol \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, C^2/ N \, m^2 \) is a physical constant.
        </p>
        <p>
            The smallest quantum of charge attainable for an object is called the <b><i>elementary charge:</i></b>
            \[e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C\]
            This is the charge of a proton and an electron; the proton is postive and the electron is negative.
